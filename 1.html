<!-- What can JavaScript Do?
Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:

Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
And more ...
Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
